Q: what function calls syscall()?
A: usertrap

Q: What is the value of p->trapframe->a7 and what does that value represent? (Hint: look user/initcode.S, the first user program xv6 starts.)
A: The value is 7 and it represents the system call number.

Q: What was the previous mode that the CPU was in?
A: kernel mode

Q: Write down the assembly instruction the kernel is panicing at. Which register corresponds to the variable num?
A: lw a3, 0(zero) and num corresponds to register a3

Q: Why does the kernel crash? Hint: look at figure 3-3 in the text; is address 0 mapped in the kernel address space? Is that confirmed by the value in scause above? (See description of scause in RISC-V privileged instructions)
A: The kernel crash becasue 0 is unused space in the disk and not mapped in the kernel address space. the scause is 0xd -- 13, load page fault, which confirms the hypothesis.

Q: What is the name of the binary that was running when the kernel paniced? What is its process id (pid)?
A: name is initcode and the process id is 1
