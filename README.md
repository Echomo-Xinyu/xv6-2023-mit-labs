# xv6-2023-mit-labs

This repository stores my solutions to different labs in [MIT 6.1810 Operating System Engineering 2023](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.S081/2023/). Please refer to different branches for specific details.

As I worked till the lab copy-on-write, I increasingly felt the importance of watching lectures to gain more insights into the xv6. As only the 2020 version has lecture recordings available, I decide to switch to the 2020 version for better learning outcome. Please refer to xv6-2020-mit-labs for the solutions.

After trying to set up the 2020 lab environment, I encountered the "infinite loop" problem when running `make qemu`. The solutions I found online do not fix the problem so I decide to go back to 2023 version.
